## Multiple Languages ##

We can use localize.js to detect what language a client speaks: https://help.localizejs.com/docs/detecting-language-of-a-visitor

Once having detected a language we can use that to create the rest of the page using predefined strings for different languages
in a JSON format. We can then load those into the state of the various pages and components to bring specific languages based
on the webpage visitor.
